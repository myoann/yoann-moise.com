									<p>I've recently asked myself : now that I want to rebuild my website entirely, what should I show on my personal website ? </p>

									<p>When I created my first website, I was 15 years old, and I was only using it to put a gallery of my family's pictures and to put the music I was creating online. <br />
									Then, I started learning programming languages, and it became the place where I was testing my skills and showing them to my parents and friends. Some of them liked what I was doing, and asked me to build their personal websites or the websites of their companies. <br />
									When I was at the university, my website became a showcase one, a place to discover the websites I created and the companies and public establisments I worked for as a freelance.</p>

									<p>Since the end of the university and the beginning of work, things have changed. My free time is now dedicated to travel, have new passions, build things and learn while going to Meetups or while using MOOCs. <br />
									In the meantime, my everyday's work let me improve my skills of Development and Management.
									</p>

									<p>One of the common things between my personal and professional life is that I do code, and my website is going to present you this part of my life.
									On the footer of the website, you can also access to some extra things such as my passions =) <br />
									Have a good visit on my website =D

								<h2 class="major">Career Path</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="./assets/images/career_path.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Career Path of Yoann Moise GIF" /></span>
									<p>In 2016, I completed two Master's Degrees in MIAGE (Business Informatics) and MBDS (Mobiquity, Web Development and Databases), from the Université Côte d'Azur. </p>

									<p>I have spent five years at the University, studying, and also developing my skills as a freelance. I mostly worked for companies which needed a website or an Android application to improve their sales.</p>
									<p>During this last year of studies, I also worked at Sopra Steria for the biggest project of this company, a web application to manage retirement processes in France. The database used had millions of entries so the challenge of this app was to handle an important amount of data while still being fast and efficient.</p>

									<p> After having graduated, I wanted to start my career in a more dynamic city than Nice. <br />
										So, I decided to move to Paris and work in a startup : Reezocar.
									My goal was to build the CRM of the company from scratch and managing all the projects and staff working on it</p>

									<p>I am interested in exploring career opportunities in IT<!--, specifically in sotfware engineering and Web / Mobile App Development--> and I would like to build a career that lets me focus on professional growth (management, technical skills, ...). <br />
