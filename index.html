					<span class="image main"><img src="./assets/images/career_path.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Career Path of Yoann Moise GIF" /></span>
						<p>In 2016, I completed two Master's Degrees in MIAGE (Business Informatics) and MBDS (Mobiquity, Web Development and Databases), from the Université Côte d'Azur. </p>

						<p>I have spent five years at the University studying and developing my skills as a freelance. 
							I mostly worked for companies which needed to build their 1st website / mobile app.</p>

						<p>During my last year of studies, I also worked for the biggest project of Sopra Steria, a retirement processes manager. 
							The database used had millions of entries so it was a challenge dealing with it while still being fast and efficient.</p>

						<p> After having graduated, I wanted to start my career in a dynamic city. <br />
							So, I decided to move to Paris and work in a startup: Reezocar.
						My goal was to build a CRM from scratch and manage all the projects & staff related to it.</p>

						<p>Three years later, Reezocar was bought by Société Générale and I decided to find a new opportunity in a french mass media company: Canal+. <br />
							There, I worked on the video player and on its deployment on new platforms such as TVs (Samsung, Philips, HiSense, ...), 
							consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X), Stores (Microsoft Store) and on existing platforms (Desktop, Mobile). <br />
							I worked there for more than 4 years.
						</p>

						<p>
							Since 2024, I live in Toulouse, in the south of France.
						</p>

						<p>I am interested in exploring career opportunities in IT and I would like to continue building a career that lets me focus on professional growth (management, tech skills).<br />
						If you like my profile, don't hesitate to contact me!</p>

						<p>
							With other software engineers from the University, we created an Android application for a Museum in France.

						<p>
							I wanted to try CSS3 new features and build a cube in 3D with interactions without using any JavaScript. 
							<br /> <br />
							The first step is to constitute the cube from differents layers and then makes it rotate on itself. On mouse over the cube, the cube expands in a fluid way.

						<p>I've recently asked myself : now that I want to rebuild my website entirely, what should I show ? </p>

						<p>
							When I created my 1st website, I was 15 years old and I was only using it to put a some pictures of my family and to put the music I was creating online. <br />
							Then, it became the place where I was improving my skills as a noob developer and showing them to my relatives. <br />
							At the University, it was my showcase platform to show all my creations.
						</p>

						<p>
							Since then, things have changed. 
							My free time is now dedicated to travel, build things and learn while going to Meetups or learning MOOCs. <br />
							Now, my work let me improve my skills of Development and Management.
						</p>

						<p>One of the common things between my personal and professional life is that I do code, and my website is going to present you this part of my life.
						On the footer, you can also access some extra things such as my passions =) </p>

						<p>Have a good visit!</p>
