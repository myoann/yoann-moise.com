	<p>As founders of Shummy and current/former college students from around the world, we are on the mission to satisfy the crave for home cooked meals of university students who are away from home or want more diverse dining options. <br/>
	Shummy is the only quick and simple mobile application that allows college students to purchase home cooked meals for pickup or delivery directly from passionate cookers on or off campus, connecting campuses with their local communities and sharing the enthusiasm for cooking and eating.</p>
